Fudge Brownies!

Ingredients:
 Melted butter, to grease
 200g pkt dark cooking chocolate, coarsely chopped
 200g butter, chopped
 3 eggs
 2 egg yolks
 270g (1 1/4 cups) caster sugar
 115g (3/4 cup) plain flour
 35g (1/3 cup) Cocoa Powder

Step 1
	Preheat oven to 160Â°C. Brush a 16 x 26cm (base measurement) slab pan with melted butter. Line with non-stick baking paper, allowing sides to overhang. This stops it sticking to the pan and makes the brownie easy to remove from the pan.
Step 2
	Melt the chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl over a saucepan half-filled with simmering water (make sure bowl doesn't touch water). Stir with a dry 	metal spoon - any moisture on the spoon makes the chocolate harden.
Step 3
	Whisk the eggs and egg yolks in a jug until combined. Allow the chocolate mixture to cool slightly before adding the egg mixture. If the chocolate mixture is too hot, the egg may start to cook and scramble. Stir to combine.
Step 4
	Combine the sugar and flour in a large bowl. Sift in the cocoa powder. Add the chocolate mixture and stir until just combined - over-stirring can make your cooked brownies tough. Pour into the prepared pan and smooth the surface.
Step 5
	Bake in oven for 45-50 minutes or until crumbs cling to a skewer inserted into the centre. Don't over-bake your brownies or they can dry out. Set aside for 6 hours or overnight to cool. This helps the brownie to set.

Notes:
	Make your brownies chewy: Chewy brownies are slightly firm and a bit sticky. Follow these tips to make them: Omit the egg yolks. Reduce the amount of butter to 150g. Use two 7.5 x 25cm (base measurement) bar pans instead of one larger slab pan.
	
	Make your brownies cakey: Cakey brownies, as the name suggests, have the light texture of a cake. Here's how to make them: Reduce the amount of butter to 125g. Add 75g (1/2 cup) self-raising flour and 1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda to the plain flour. Storing brownies: Add 60ml (1/4 cup) milk after adding the flour.
